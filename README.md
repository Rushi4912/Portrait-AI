# 🌙 Storybook AI  
AI-powered personalized bedtime stories for kids

Storybook AI is a production-grade SaaS platform that generates personalized bedtime stories for children using AI.  
Each child becomes the hero of their own story through custom **FLUX LoRA training**, with consistent characters, illustrations, and narrated audio.

The platform is built as a **TurboRepo monorepo**, with a modern SaaS dashboard, scalable backend, and AI services designed for real-world production use.

- 📖 AI-generated bedtime stories (safe, age-appropriate)
- 🎨 Illustrated story pages with character consistency
- 🔊 Story narration using **ElevenLabs** (natural voice TTS)
- 🧠 Custom prompts and emotion-aware storytelling
- 🔐 Secure authentication with **Clerk**
- 📊 Professional SaaS dashboard for parents
- ☁️ Cloudflare-powered infrastructure

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Parents upload child images
2. Images are used to train a **FLUX LoRA** model
3. The trained model represents the child as a story hero
4. AI generates:
   - A bedtime story
   - Matching illustrations
   - Voice narration via ElevenLabs
5. Stories are stored and accessible anytime from the dashboard
